August 3, 2011

	- Added validation of the -lang/--lang directive to close critical vulnerability.
	http://bugs.weblite.ca/view.php?id=786  (This merged change from 2508:2509 from the
	trunk.

Xataface 1.3rc4 2458
July 20, 2011

	- Turned off indexing on tables that don't have the index enabled.
	- Added support for timediff MySQL function.  Added tests also.
	- Changed so that session timeout refers to logout after inactivity rather 
	  than logout after time after session created.
	- Changed session_timeout to an integer just in case this was causing problems before.
	- Removed some bits that draw strict warnings in PHP 5.3
	- Fixed bug that was caused by allowing actions to override the relationships.ini file 
	  action definitions.  The problem was that all related actions were being overridden by 
	  relationships.ini action definitions.  The fix was to add a directive for the 
	  actions.ini file to explicitly set an action as overridable by the relationships.ini file.
	- The related_records_list action has been given the directive:
		allow_override=relationships.ini
	  which says that any settings placed in the relationships.ini action: definition 
	  will override details of this action.
	- Added support for disable_session_ip_check in conf.ini file.
	- Fixed updating but with multiple dataface__version records being added
	- Changed errors when inserting new related record of type foreign key constraint 
	  failures to be a notice instead of a fatal error so it will give the user a 
	  friendlier error message.
	- Changed session to just log the user out if their session has the wrong session id.
	- Removed 'here' debugging text that shouldn't have been there in main template.
	- Fixed error with overriding PEAR::raiseError (a static method) with a non-static 
	  method.  Now XML_Parser::raiseError is static.
	- Improved relationship labeling on find form
	- Added support for visibility:find in relationships to hide a relationship from 
	  the find form.
	




Xataface 1.3rc3 2167
April 13, 2011

	- Changed search results to show portions of page that match query
	- Increased time limit on manage_build_index to unlimited - and closed session at 
	  beginning of action to prevent user from being locked out.
	- Fixed up the pluggable architecture for searches.
	- Added IP address check in the session to prevent people from spoofing sessions
	- Fixed search index to index entire record contents instead of just previews.
	- Added optimize table command when building index.
	- Improved site search options by making it so that you no longer need to have 2 types of 
	  find_actions in order for the site search to work.  Also removed the 'filter by' option at 
	  the top of the search results if there is only one type of record in the found set.
	- Fixed error in IE when clicking '+' sign next to record in list view - undefined variable 
	  df_add_editable_awareness

Xataface 1.3rc2 2139
April 9, 2011

	- Fixed serious issue with outputcache that caused users to be able to log in as other users.  
	  If using output caching you MUST update.
	- Fixed issue with output cache - warnings on HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH
	- Added support for passwordTwice css class that can be applied to a password field to make 
		users enter the password twice - and forces it to match in order to submit the form.
	- Added clear_views action and permission to control panel
	- Added change_password action to actions.ini file so it will show up next to My Profile in the 
	  UI
	- Added setPassword method to the authentication tool.  This is used by the change password 
	  function... Adding this to the authentication tool allows us to tie the functionality to the 
	  authentication plugin which is the way it should be.
	- REmoved debugging code from config.inc.php
	- Fixed issue on 5.3 with output cache... a warning about missing key.
	- Fixed issue with function options containing arithmetic expressions.
	- Added support for literals and string arithmetic in the SQL parser.  This has been badly 
	  needed for a long time.   Still may be lacking support in where clause or function parameters.

Xataface 1.3rc1 2092
March 31, 2011

	-Fixed path separators and directory separators to be platform independent in installer.
	-Fixed notice of undefined variable in PHP 5.3.5
	-Added support for the getNavItem and isNavItemSelected delegate class methods to provide more 
	 flexibility for the navigation menus.  Now the navigation menu can contain more than just 
	 tables.
	-Fixed E_STRICT warning messages (PHP 5.3)
	-Added support for the --no-query request parameter which prevents the application from 
	 loading the record set matching the query.  If this parameter is set, then the
	 Dataface_Application::getRecord() method will return null and the 
	 Dataface_Application::getResultSet() will return an empty result set.  Similarly the 
	 Dataface_QueryTool::loadResult() method will return an empty result set if passed the 
	 --no-query parameter as part of the query in its third parameter.   THis is part of the 
	 solution to the problem reported at http://xataface.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=5983.
	-Fixed issue with record dialog when adding new records... javascript was being run twice.  
	 Now it is not
	-Added user feedback of which column the result set is currently sorted on
	-Added fix for windows cached file names in getBlob action.
	 http://www.xataface.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=4149
	-Added support saveMessage() and @@ message notation.  This allows you to pass the 
	 --msg parameter in the session instead of through the GET url.  You would then use 
	 the --msg=@@ to indicate that the ['--msg'] property should be used for the message
	-Added support for the beforeCopy() and afterCopy() triggers
	-Added some css classes to items in login prompt
	-Added username to the default reset password email so that the user knows which username's 
	 password is to be reset
	-Fixed Calendar positioning problem in IE.  Still needs some more testing but appears to work 
	 in IE 6 and IE 8.
	-Added permission 'clear views' specifically for the clear views action.  By default no role 
	 has access to this.  So only if users with ALL() permission can use the clear views action
	-Added action to clear the xataface auto-generated views.  This is necessary often when the 
	 database is modified (in structure only).
	-Added support for visibility:update directive which allows you to hide fields from the update 
	 form
	-Added new blocks before_login_username, after_login_username, after_login_password, and 
	 after_login_submit on the Dataface_Login_Prompt.html template.  This allows us to add some custom content in those places of the login form.
	-Fixed style for column-legend so it doesn't overflow
	-Fixed support for column:label directive.  Added support for column:legend directive to add 
	 legend for columns in result list and related list
	-Added support for column:label directive in related list (was already supported in regular list)
	-Fixed intermittent problem with parse_repeated in case it is called with a blank delimiter.
	-Fixed strict warning on line 41 of ModuleTool
	-Added check to ensure that application has a templates_c directory that is writable by the web 
	 server --- new restriction for 1.3
	-Fixed installer to use replace instead of update so that first time update works properly
	-Removed plone_javascript_variables.js.php and plone menu javascript... these aren't used at all so it just added to bloat
	-Updated getProxyView to work with tables that aren't set up for multilingual content even if 
	 app is set to use multilingual content.  Proxy views dramatically improve performance when 
	 tables define the __sql__ directive in the fields.ini file.
	-Changed url of the Xataface forum to the current address.. This just popped up on some error screens
	-Fixed a number of E_STRICT warnings.  Refactored LanguageTool and PermissionsTool so that all 
	 methods can be called either statically or as member methods... Had to create second classes 
	 for both of these so that getInstance() returns instance of the alternative class... and all 
	 methods are declared static on the existing class.  This will best maintain compatibility with 
	 existing source code.  Also fixed a number of assign by reference warnings.  Tested small set 
	 of main actions in strict mode.  Still much work to be done
	-Updated ConfigTool and Application to support modules placed in the DATAFACE_SITE_PATH/modules 
	 directory instead of the DATAFACE_PATH/modules directory.
	-Updated translations with latest from the translation spreadsheet
	-Added spanish language file... it is way out of date (circa 2007) but at least it's a start


Xataface 1.2.7 1966
November 29, 2010

	-Added forgot password action... not tied into interface yet but is functional.  
	-Added getEmailColumn() method to AuthenticationTool.
	-Added support for show_jump_menu preference
	-Fixed issue that caused some errors not to display on registration form.  Added improved support for validateRegistrationForm delegate class method so that it is used in both the activate and register method.. and returning a value of 2 (int) indicates that not only did the registration data validate ok, it instructs Xataface to skip the rest of the default validation.  This is helpful if the validation for unique usernames doesn't work with the application's constrains for some reason (e.g. multi-column unique key for users)
	-Fixed possible XSS script vulnerability with --msg parameter
	-Updated related record tabs to respect the 'view related records' permission.


Xataface 1.2.6 1955
October 25, 2010

	-Added check that delegate contains the filterPermissions method.  Responding to http://xataface.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=5553
	-Added error codes for withstanding foreign key constraint failures when adding new related records.  See http://xataface.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=5530
	-Updated XML output to support calculated fields on related records.
	-Fixed xmlTail delegate method support
	-Added date and time functions to mysql dialect for SQL parser.
	-Added preferences options to hide related sections in view tab, and record search in view tab
	-Fixed incorrect icons on some actions: http://xataface.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=5507
	-Fixed bug with container field field names on windows: http://xataface.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=5465
	-Fixed finfo_file() call:  http://xataface.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=5492
	-Changed sql parser to default to MySQL dialect.  This fixes issue in Relationship where parser was running in ansi mode
	-Added support for external translation management systems by adding an 'External' translation status
	-Added support for xmlTail delegate method, and xml attribute in fields.ini file to use calculated fields as part of xml dump
	-Throws exception in relationship init() method now if there is a failure.  This exception is used to catch errors in select widget when trying to make it editable.
	-Fixed 'otice: Undefined index: auth_type in D:\wamp\www\imm\dataface\Dataface\AuthenticationTool.php on line 84'
	-Fixed 'Notice: Use of undefined constant key - assumed 'key' in /xataface/Dataface/SearchForm.php on line 347'
	-Added XATAFACE_DISABLE_PROXY_VIEWS option
	-Added test for problematic query.  Seems to be working ok.
	-Disabled proxy views when multilingual content is enabled.  Since the view has a different name than the source table it is unable to be translated by the Query Translator.  This effectively fixes multilingual content translation when grafted fields are used in a table (e.g. __sql__='...')
	-Fixed so that relationships derived from valuelists do not show up as actions/tabs
	-Fixed add to select function to correct IE compatibility problems
	-Added the ability to add new records to valuelists for select widgets inline... but only if the valuelist uses __sql__ to pull its values from the database.
	-Added the ability to add new records to checkbox groups that are built on a relationship.  Utilizes the RecordDialog widget previously developed for the lookup widget.  Similar things should soon be created for all widgets that use valuelists or relationships.
	-Forgot to commit update for register action to support the register permission instead of the new permission.
	-Added check to make sure that a relationship exists in the getField() method.  This will propagate errors up another level so that they make more sense
	-Fixed getTitles() bug ... it loaded all of the records into memory for the jump menu.. 


Xataface 1.2.5 1870
June 18, 2010

	-Fixed metadata not being updated when saving related record.  Thanks to fantomasdm.
	-Fixed notice at line 62 of delete_file action that caused a notice when deleting an attachment from a table where there is no mimetype field associated with the container
	-Fixed XSS scripting vulnerability in search and full-path disclosure
	-Fixed warning about undefined variable  on line 2046 of Table.php
	-Added logger class to log notices and error messages
	-Fixed PermissionsTool delegate to only contain the filterPermissions(&, &) method.  This can be used to filter the permissions on a temporary basis.  In particular it is usedby the register action right now to convert the register permission to the new permission.
	-Added ajax_record_details, before_ajax_record_details, and after_ajax_record_details slots to the Dataface_AjaxRecordDetails.html template
	-Added val() method as shortcut to getValue()
	-Fixed php notice if filter is not set
	-Fixed issue with blank queries being kept in the query.
	-Added {filters} tag to templates to show result filters
	-Fixed broken tags in registration template introduced by last commit
	-Added heading to registration form and slot to override this header: registration_form_label
	-Added Dataface_Registration.label string which is used for heading of the registration form
	-Fixed register action to use the register permission instead of the new permission.
	-Added support for a permissions tool delegate if you need to slightly modify how permissions are handled temporarily
	-Added support for before_authenticate trigger in application delegate class
	-Added support for startSession method in application delegate class
	-Fixed 'Notice: Undefined variable: HTTP_SESSION_VARS' on line 78 of config.inc.php



Xataface 1.2.4 1811
May 13, 2010

	- Updated strings to use Xataface instead of Dataface
	- Updated fineprint finally to show 2010 and Xataface instead of Dataface
	- Fixed toJS() method to use json_encode() instead of adhoc formation that sometimes failed for complex content
	- Added xhtml editing and remove formatting buttons to nicEdit
	- Fixed issue with Calendar not showing correct start times for events.
	- Fixed issue with grafted fields overriding the field definition of already existent fields.  This would cause problems for the new related record form and possibly elsewhere (http://xataface.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=5154)
	- Fixed view tab bug where nothing appears if first field is part of a field group. http://xataface.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=5168
	- Fixed unquoted string in preg_grep (line 874 error)
	- Default display expanded now for field groups in find form.  I'm not sure how these ever was set to default collapsed.
	- Fixed issue with updating fields with the value 0.  Used to ignore these updates, confusing it with a blank update.
	- Added support for getTemplateContext() delegate method
	- If parser fails caching is aborted
	- Fixed redirect after adding new record to go to view tab if the user doesn't have the edit permission for the record.
	- Added after_action_activate event.
	- fixed path of query_cache_log
	- Added preliminary support for duplicate column names in relationships.

	- Fixed error checking if unquoted string is defined.


	- Made a whole host of changes to try to support PHP 5.3.  In particular I created a special implementation of parse_ini_file to run for PHP 5.3.0 and 5.3.1 to work around bugs in their implementation (these bugs are reportedly fixed in SVN and thus should be part of 5.3.2, but this is a stop-gap measure. Other changes include removing =& notation for new objects (as this is deprecated), and removal of all ereg() calls where I could find them (also deprecated). 
	- All ereg calls were changed to preg_match calls.
	- Removed explicit error reporting call.
	- Added headings to CSV export when no relationship is present.  For consistency.
	- Set constant when stripping slashes for magic_quotes_gpc so that future attempts can be cancelled based on it already occuring (e.g. HTML_QuickForm).
	- Disabled strip slashes in QuickForm if they've already been stripped in config.inc.php.
	- Fixed slashes when magic_quotes_gpc is enabled.  This was causing all kinds of problems with ajax methods like the datagrid.
	- Fixed related record form so that grafted fields only show up if they are marked as transient.
	- Added support for secure flag on container fields to use the get_blob method so that it respects application permissions.  Note that it is necessary to secure the directory that stores the file uploads manually to prevent unauthorized downloads.
	- Updated skintool to support application delegate breadcrumbs method.
	- Removed short open tags so it should now be compatible if short open tags are turned off.
	- Changed single_record_search to respect the 'view' and 'view in rss' permissions.
	- Added support for getSingleRecordSearchFeed delegate class method to customize the single record search feed.  Works identical to the getFeed() method except that it also takes a Dataface_Record as the first parameter.


Xataface 1.2.3b1 1690
Jan. 5, 2010
	-Changed to make compatible with PHP 5.3.

Xataface 1.0-beta-1
March 2008

	See Xataface manual for full features.

Dataface 0.8 unstable
June 12, 2007
	Changes
		1. Added FormTool class to factor out all of the generic form code from
			Dataface_QuickForm.  Also added classes Dataface_FormTool_xxx for
			each widget type.  Creating custom widgets is not possible and 
			easy.  This will form the foundation of a new API for building 
			widgets.  Developers should be able to develop and install new
			widgets easily.
		2. Fixed bugs with Relationships using vocabulary:existing option 
		   (variables not defined).
		   
Dataface 0.7.3.3
June 11, 2007
	Changes
		1. Added Ontology classes:
			The Ontology classes provide a framework for dealing with data in a more  
			generic way.  Ontologies can be created that wrap tables in any database  
			and allow them to be used in a common way.  For example, a news ontology  
			could be created that would allow you to work with any table as if it 
			stored news items.  It would find the fields that are used for the 
			pertinent pieces of data and allow them to be accessed in a common way.
			
			This is used by the registration actions.
			
		2. Added getByID and setByID static functions to IO.php to allow records and
			fields to be accessed by URI.
			
		3. Minor syntax bugfix in Table.php
		
		4. In templates/Dataface_RecordHistory.html:
			Fixed action to restore records to previous version.  The previous action
			was missing the -table POST parameter.  This parameter was important for
			locating the correct history record.
			
		5. In templates/Dataface_MainTemplate.html:
			Added more javascript global variables to make it easier to reference
			Dataface URLs from javascript functions: DATAFACE_SITE_HREF, DATAFACE_URL
			
		6. In SkinTool.php:
			Added some more user friendly error messages to appear when the compiled
			templates directory cannot be accessed.  This is important for
			shared servers with SAFE mode enabled because Dataface won't
			be able to create the subdirectories that it wants to create
			in the templates_c directory, so the user will have to create
			them himself.  The error messages now inform the user what has happened
			and instructs him on how to create the necessary directories himself.
		
		7. DB.php
			Added debugging output option in Dataface_DB if the DATAFACE_DEBUG_DB
			constant is set.
			
		8. LanguageTool.php:
			Fixed minor bug that prevented languages other than English from showing
			up as bold in the language selector when they are selected.
			
		9. Added new register action to allow users to register.  Created activate   
			action also to allow users to activate their accounts from an automated   
			email.
			Modified the actions.ini file also to make it more readable, while adding
			the two new actions.

		   relationships to be managed via simple checkboxes.

			record that the action is applied to (not just the current record
			of the request).

		  of the dumbest things to be added to PHP).

		  of the '-search' parameter when deleting records.  This was a major bug.
