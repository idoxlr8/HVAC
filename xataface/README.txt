++Overview

Xataface is an application framework for developing data-driven web applications
in PHP and MySQL.  It is intended to bring MySQL more inline with applications
like Filemaker for ease of use and speed of development.  Using this framework,
a developer can design his database using his favorite database tool (e.g.
PHPMyAdmin) and have a fully-functional web application up and running within only 
a few minutes.

Once the application is running, the developer can configure all aspects of it
by way of simple INI files, and powerful PHP delegate classes (to extend the 
functionality of the basic application.


++Installation Instructions
	
#Unpack the xataface-xx.xx.xx.tar.gz file and copy the resulting dataface file to a location inside your web server's document root.
		
#Make the xataface/Dataface/templates_c directory writable by the web server. (an unsafe way to do this is chmod 777 templates_c)
		
#Point web browser to http://yourdomain.com/path/to/xataface/dataface_info.php to confirm that installation is successful.
